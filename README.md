## Welcome to the NoteMe App! 👋

This is a notes application for you to note down your ideas or any important information. Save it as a bookmark, login and stay loggedin to keep adding, reviewing your notes in just a click! 

This is a demo account for you to try it out:

Email: john@gmail.com
Password: cookies

Functionalities:

1. Add new notes - currently takes a prompt. 😶
2. Edit existing notes - finally textarea editing enabled, so no more prompts! 😁
3. Delete any notes - would you like to confirm before delete? Would love your review. ❤

If you like it, feel free to sign up and use. Thank you. 🙌

Also, here's the Figma Prototype which I created first to be able to bring this into life 🧬:

P.S. I am still learning, any feedback is highly appreciated.
